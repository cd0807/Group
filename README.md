Introduction
     Many current systems used for instructor/course evaluation relies on evaluation forms to be hand-crafted and then made available to students. This process can be time consuming to produce an appropriate evaluation form for each class. Another option would be to use a general evaluation form for multiple courses, which could provide results for questions that donâ€™t necessarily apply to some courses. An alternative to these methods would be to streamline the evaluation form creation process by dynamically and automatically designing them to provide appropriate questions pertaining to the course. This course evaluation system seeks to achieve this by generating relevant questions that apply to a course based off of existing material, such as a course syllabus.
